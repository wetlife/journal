I have not seen a disagreement that I thought was worth lives. Does fighting make a person tough? Forfeiting thinking for fighting appears to turn righteousness into wrongfulness. Can we think of a better way?

What if we use the money, energy, and passion currently dedicated to an ironically named Department of Defense to find appropriate resolutions to problems? What are you willing to spend to find resolutions which don't cost lives to raise hate?

Peaceful resolutions may be hard to find. People commend soldiers for participating in fights we all fund. What if people spent the same money and lives on clever diplomacy that avoids wars? What if we use love to spread love?

One idea is to reward diplomacy. What if there was a system to which any person can contribute diplomatic ideas and be rewarded for bringing a good idea? What if people could work together to find an elusive peaceful resolution?

Wikipedia's Software Industry article reads "according to industry analyst Gartner, the size of the worldwide software industry in 2013 was US$407.3 billion." Even in this well funded industry, many of the most effective tools are created and actively maintained by thousands of volunteers. I am talking about open-sourced software.

The term opensource refers to software whose source-code is freely editable. This allows any person to contribute a resolution to any issue. In this way, the opensource community offers competitive solutions which are licensed to remain freely editable by posterity.

Can opensource show us how to collaborate on ideas for peaceful resolutions? Opensource provides solutions which competed with with the leading products of a US$400 billion industry with notable successes. Opensource software dominates the market for web servers and secure cheap personal computing playgrounds.
