## personal journal and todo
This repo-sents <- (: :) my personal journal. My personal journal is intended to contain all manner of record-worthy thoughts while remaining sufficiently uncluttered by philosophical reflections that the journal can remain useable as something to read at a later date for ideas to further/pursue/maintain when time and other resources allow.    
## my journal is text-based-memory
