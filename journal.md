I need to look for a job in food research. I will work this job to repay my student loans. I believe I can repay my loans within two years, so I plan three years so that I am unlikely to disappoint my plans but I can, nonetheless develop a years-long plan for myself
While working to pay off my loans I hope to:
*while doing everything else, I want to extend my education independently (
After I repay my student loans, at some point I hope to:
*continue being happy;
*live with a nearby stream;

I should make a separate life-plan-document

My custom date script, /usr/bin/kyDate: 
```sh

#!/bin/sh
date +%C%y.%m.%d@%H:%M
```
