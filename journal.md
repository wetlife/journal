I need to look for a job in food research. I will work this job to repay my student loans. I believe I can repay my loans within two years, so I plan three years so that I am unlikely to disappoint my plans but I can, nonetheless develop a years-long plan for myself

While working to pay off my loans I hope to:
* while doing everything else, I want to extend my education independently (

After I repay my student loans, at some point I hope to:
* continue being happy;
* live with a nearby stream;
* work on improving education by teaching calculus at a young age and making more interesting example problems.
* make a plant-based diet more accessible to the average consumer:
  * make a plant-based cheese
  * make quick, easy, and cheap options like ramen, rice and beans, pasta,....

I should make a separate life-plan-document

My custom date script, /usr/bin/kydate: 
```sh
#!/bin/sh
date +%C%y.%m.%dat%H:%M
```

My custom git-syncing script, /usr/bin/kygitcommit:
```sh
#!/bin/sh
git add .
git commit -m "$1"
git push
```

journaling workflow:
* open journal in vim
* insert appropriately phrased datestamp in journal at first line of new entry with ```:r !kydate```
* journal, save, and exit vim
* sync repo to origin with ```sh $kygitcommit```

life plan as it stands:
* stay in touch with Jenna
* work in food research to repay my student loans
 * I want to make vegan options more accessible and available. I believe food science and its industry will help me make a pallatable vegan cheese. It seems promising to make vegan cheese on a plant-based substrate with percentages of protein, fat, and carbs matched to the percentages of milk. This gives a first approximation to the wonderful substrate milk provides. This approximation can be refined by changing types of proteins, carbs, and fats to better match those of milk. Also, bacteria and yeast can be bred(cultured) or bioengineered(genetically augmented) to prefer a different substrate. Also, the new substrate may just give a flavor profile which people can acquire a taste for.
