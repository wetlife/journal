\subsection*{\#loveLife}
This is some stuff. The stuff is words, really. The amazing thing is I get to string them together however I please.

I am so in love because of who Amanda Chadderdon is and how lovingly Amanda has behaved toward me. I am scared to tell her this because I think it may scare her off. I don't know what to do.

I say "I'm not sure what to do" as though, and I want to joke that "I \textbf{AM} sure I'll be happy however my life pans out." but I say "I'm not sure" as though...I LOST THE THOUGHT OVER THE COURSE OF HOURS...

\subsection*{\#lifePlan} CONTINUED FROM YESTERDAY'S THOUGHT:
"I have come to the conclusion that..." I should create a vegan cheese while I'm looking for work and working off student loans as a cab-driver. In order to plan and verify feasability, I calculate some basic time requirements imposed by all the things I want to do(after this table, a current plan is to be kept in tabulated form in weeklyTimeTable.tex):

\begin{table}
\caption{\label{tab:originalWeeklyAndDailyTimeTable}Weekly and Daily Time-Table}
\begin{tabular}{|r|r|l|}
\hline
Hours/Week&Hours/Day&Activity\\
\hline
7&1&hygiene\\
7&1&workout\\
49&12$\times$4+1&drive a cab\\
14&2&social and play time\\
42&6&sleep\\
21&3&study graduate physics courses\\
28&4&journal and invent\\
\hline
\end{tabular}\end{table}

This gives $7 \text{days} \times 24 \text{hours} = 168$ hours per week, accounting for the all hours in a week. I intend to investigate using food, sleep, and drugs to augment my productivity in learning and inventing. Here, inventing can be broadly interpretted.

\subsection*{\#invention}
Invention could mean creating a vegan cheese by chemical synthesizing a substrate with the desired percentages and types of fat, protein, and carbohydrate. Invention could mean designing a belt for runners to store an empty or full water bladder in, as well as shopping bags, a phone, pens, keys, clean and dry clothes, and other items. Invention could mean designing a pair of gloves with all the things listed for the belt attached as well as carrying pouches to provide runners with an ergonomic upper-body workout while running.

Make idealab: a database of possibly networked ideas, unsolved problems, and solutions which are easily searched by users. An idea of a use-case: lab A at some institution has a problem which impedes its progress and so it checks with idealab for a solution. Because the solution to this probelem hasn't been catalogued in an appropriately findable manner, lab A submits this problem to idealab.

Lab B has problem P. Lab B searches for a solution using standard methods. lab B finds lab A's record of problem P on ideaLab. Lab B registers another incidence of problem P.

{\bf Continued from 2015.08.26at15:18}
IdeaLab has a system to rank ideas relative to one another. An idea's rank is a function that increases with the number of users who had this idea. Rank increases with the number of viewers it has.

Think of additional variables that rank varies with. The single most important task in creating ideaLab is to make idea browsing and discovery of ideas work well. IdeaLab is a great way to bring ideas of how to help the human endeavor to the layperson.

This title was a mistake when learning a new prompt named xonsh. It feels like it should in principle be possible to design the currently best ever computer interface based on the keyboard.

I of course say this because I've already done it, though it seems like it would take conscious thought to undertake. I need to coach myself to victory here because my reach into wonderful possibilities seems extended by wealth.

The interface is simply a set of keyboard bindings close to those of vi. There is no copyrighted interaction here. Download costs pay custodial engineers-in-training. The teachers will guide the educations of these interns.

It is like a programming language but needs no infrastructure. The people's desire to use such a wonderful interface will carry this mode of interaction with the computer to wherever they go. It needs something like a new language of documentation to maintain portability.

The documentation will be just the needed words to communicate the necessary functions completely. Discussions of essentials and really anything belong outside the documentation. I provide an example used to describe the current vission of this interface.

\subsection*{ A Machine-learning Approach to the Management of Time }
Split the day into three sectors of eight hours, as I have heard is customarily done in Japan. This gives eight hours for sleep, eight hours for work, and eight hours of other time. This is a way to divide one's daily time into three things many find to be necessary in his or her life.

I can sleep eight hours, work eight hours, excercise two hours, take personal care for one hour, allow three hours of incidental time such as maintaining my home or tending to bills. After these allowances I still have two hours of time everyday to use for arbitrary activities.

I want to journal and learn every day. These are what I find fulfilling in the course of a day. These things are fulfilling when I can manage the rest of my life satisfactorily.

I want to experiment sticking to this regimen for two weeks. I want to review my objective productivity in each sector by some measurable quantity, I want to review my performance at work, review my amount of energy, review my health while remembering that nourishment plays a huge role in health and must be sufficient, review my learning over this span of time, and review my performance on utilizing the time for each task as intended.

What I am doing is setting up a system to analytically address my fulfillment. This is the end goal in life: to live in a fulfilling manner. I define fulfillment as satisfaction with one's time. Satisfaction can be the performance measure gained from the reviews.

View the task as living well. I define living well by maintaining health, tending to the future, and feeling fulfilled. Machine learning can be utilized to maximize the fruits of one's labors when defining things this way. What one needs is a starting point to work from. A starting point has been provided above. 

Consider Tom M. Mitchell's definition of machine-learning: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E." Let T be living a day well. Let P be reviews. Let E be days lived. This defines living well as a problem of a learning machine.

Humans can function as machines learning to live better. Humans already get to define how they each measure living well. This framework allows a quantitative means for this task. This quantitative means is used in a feedback-loop for continuous improvement at task T: living life fulfillingly.

\subsection*{ Great minds throughout time have been the first to think of things. }
All the wonderful ever first seen have been seen already. This means the target of seeking truth moves. This means the seeking of new truths never before entered into the historical record moves further and down a sometimes counterintuitively branched logical rabbit hole of the state of predictions.

\subsection*{ I love science because... }
I love science because all of the wonderful things it does. What is being said with the word "because" in the previous sentence? One interpretation could be that the sentence just makes one feel good.

On analysis, however, we get to the good stuff. That is the fun and other utility are maximized. I want to be reading about python's natural language processing module. I have this belief that if I love Jenna then I should say something now because what if she marries Alex? I should lay everything on her as the hero of my own story could be heroically romanticized to do. I should say only the friendliest, warmest things because that is what the hero of my story will do.

I simply want to get Jenna's excitement about topics scientific. This want is because I've experienced how energizing and pleasing it is to be adored by Jenna.

Cluster descriptions of Sustainable and Healthy Community's(SHC's)tools in a space $\mathbb{S}=$ roles $\times$ subroles $\times$ fundamental objectives $\times$ objectives $\times$ concepts. Vary the number of clusters used in a k-means algorithm within $\mathbb{S}$. Give clustering data and code to the developers of Decision Path Library(DPL). This tool can be a means of crowd-sourcing the development of DPL by informing the DPL's labeling of points in $\mathbb{S}$ with concepts.

DPL can utilize the feedback users give that additional labels are desired. The SHC-Tools-Inventory webapp can use the DPL's labels and allow users to seve tools and dismiss tools from the cart. Tools that strongly correlate weak cart-scores with some subspace $\mathbb{S}'$ of $\mathbb{S}$ tell DPL not to specify $l$ in $\mathbb{S}'$. Weak cart-scores indicate lack of accuracy in mapping concepts to tools. 

A weak cart-score is a small ratio of cart-additions to total suggestions of the label.

\subsection*{ mathouts }
Using the limits upon which calculus is based allows folding an operation in on itself infinitely many times. All operations are functions. My mathematics needs a notation for a unary operator signifying a specified number of recursions.

This notation is a foundational element of a language with which logical machines may be constructed. It allows me to carry any solution I've discovered to any language I please. This tool permits a mathematical language that allows describing algorithms.

This description of the algorithm could serve as part of a deliverable that a software engineer would sell. An engineer could deliver an independent description of the requirements of the solution delivered. A solution delivered along with its description could then be implemented in any language anywhere its application provided utility to some player.

I want to write about preparing and eating food as an act of self-love. I want to write a simple introduction to the trunk of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics(STEM). I want to write about humans' rightful stewardship of the culture of plants, animals, bacteria, and fungi humans exist through.

\subsection*{ My trajectory through the science of food. }
I believe I have found my greatest ability to reduce suffering through the scientific harvest, preservation, and preparation of food. I have never believed that I would contribute through the greatness of my abilities. The things I have found to save human lives are simple.

People can experience unkown joys through the flavors, satiation, and fitness gained from eating and hence being well. They say you are what you eat. They also say diet is 80% of health and exercise is the complementary 20%. This reinforces the message from before: eat to be well.

Fermentation is proper preservation. Seeds are a good substitute for refined oil. Refined suger causes immediate spikes in blood-pressure. Equivalent amounts of sugar in the form of whole plants contain fiber which is beleieved to stabilize blood pressure upon ingestion.

\subsection*{ These last couple of days have been worth more than I will ever be able to afford. I thank those who have brought all my joy forth. }
I have babbled at people through my haze of drunk with love for them. I wish I could remember everyone's name. Here goes an attempt to recount what I've found.

I feel gifted by a confident delivery of a dance. This dance was exemplified by Damon's newfound singing, Sequoia's beautiful voicings, and a nameless shredded man's literally literal dancing. I felt loved the whole time by Jonnny's accepting and guiding presence. Jonny acts so admirably that it sets a sterling example for how to let be. Let be as in let everyone else be and tend to themselves by confidently being me.

When was the last time I ever felt so good? I would recall if I only could. So many smiles to reflect that my face feels too small to see all these smiles while returning them all.

I wish for nothing now as lay to sleep this good night. I hope not only to lift these people with my life, but maybe I can bring them into some others' sight. Face cracking smiles make entire lives' worth of smiles seem led to be left to all right.

I need to use the Maillard-reaction and fermentation show veganism to feel nice. This is shown to herbivores and carnivores at nothing but just the the right kind of price. I cannot even dream of someone not finding great food to come from just beans, dark green leafies, and whole grains like oats, rye, wheat, and rice.

I don't hope to hurt any more things than I have already by being where I be. I hope to remember to allow everyone the original sin of doing what they've done. Just as we have all evolved from our whole ancestry, I give when I remember the grace of loving all versions of me.

Gifts I have for my friends are the messages of a healthy way to be. I hope to live so that those close can see a shining example of this life from me.

\subsection*{ This is a great idea for research in education. }
Students could be tested on their knowledge by teaching others. Many say real learning occurs when teaching others. Let us put this thought to the test in a way that allows education to pay for itself.

The cost of education is reduced to the time it takes to measure teaching. I expect this method will engender students' feelings of solidarity, appreciation, and admiration toward teachers. Students also take on the jobs of many teachers. This job-taking is proper form of subsidy for education: a subsidy that benefits the educators and the students. Social barriers to teaching may be eliminated through research driven via this means.

Students can learn from lessons developed to the standards of what is expected to be taught. Using recorded lessons lets us greatly objectify and optimize tutelage. Teachers may experiment with different presentation styles and orderings via this means.

I see losing jobs in teaching. I see gaining work in experimenting with improving education. Jobs that consist of reciting lecture material are replaced with the work.

Work is needed planning the order of topics. Work is needed creating alternative styles of presentation. Work is needed analyzing the data for continuous integration of results. These analyzed results may inform future work in planning. This gives a cycle which may be arbitrarily reduced with proper attendance to the statistics I hope will become a standard subject for all members of the population to one day be taught because statistics gives great power to science hence scientists hence consumers of the benefits of science.

Varying presentation style can become a distributed task. This allows us to leverage the abundant population for data from research on optimizing education and learning. Learning gains interest as a topic of research because machines can help us learn how to learn better by testing models of learning.

For example, neural networks could be built to model patterns of learning. Rates of learning may then be objectively tested by comparing rates of convergence in accuracy between different models.

\subsection*{ Subsidizing education is help we can give those suffering. }
Using methods oulined in 2017.07.24at06:35 can extend an extremely cheap and effective education to people in need. Education is claimed by many to be the best help that may be given to the "impoverished." Present video lectures for free as research education. Request donations of data on the performance of students-turned-teachers.

There is only a need to demonstrate the power of the tools being taught to motivate students to learn. Illustrate power by first modeling some system simply. Subsequently optimize that system by bijection within known bounds. This optimization strategy converges to correctness in a logarithmic number of trials given some pair of known bounds and a desired precision of accuracy.
