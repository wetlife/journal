This is some stuff. The stuff is words, really. The amazing thing is I get to string them together however I please.

I am so in love because of who Amanda Chadderdon is and how lovingly Amanda has behaved toward me. I am scared to tell her this because I think it may scare her off. I don't know what to do.

I say "I'm not sure what to do" as though, and I want to joke that "I \textbf{AM} sure I'll be happy however my life pans out." but I say "I'm not sure" as though...I LOST THE THOUGHT OVER THE COURSE OF HOURS...

\subsection*{\#lifePlan} CONTINUED FROM YESTERDAY'S THOUGHT:
"I have come to the conclusion that..." I should create a vegan cheese while I'm looking for work and working off student loans as a cab-driver. In order to plan and verify feasability, I calculate some basic time requirements imposed by all the things I want to do(after this table, a current plan is to be kept in tabulated form in weeklyTimeTable.tex):

\begin{table}
\caption{\label{tab:originalWeeklyAndDailyTimeTable}Weekly and Daily Time-Table}
\begin{tabular}{|r|r|l|}
\hline
Hours/Week&Hours/Day&Activity\\
\hline
7&1&hygiene\\

14&2&social and play time\\
42&6&sleep\\
21&3&study graduate physics courses\\
28&4&journal and invent\\
\hline
\end{tabular}\end{table}

This gives $7 \text{days} \times 24 \text{hours} = 168$ hours per week, accounting for the all hours in a week. I intend to investigate using food, sleep, and drugs to augment my productivity in learning and inventing. Here, inventing can be broadly interpretted.

\subsection*{\#invention}
Invention could mean creating a vegan cheese by chemical synthesizing a substrate with the desired percentages and types of fat, protein, and carbohydrate. Invention could mean designing a belt for runners to store an empty or full water bladder in, as well as shopping bags, a phone, pens, keys, clean and dry clothes, and other items. Invention could mean designing a pair of gloves with all the things listed for the belt attached as well as carrying pouches to provide runners with an ergonomic upper-body workout while running.

An idea of a use-case: lab A at some institution has a problem which impedes its progress and so it checks with idealab for a solution. Because the solution to this probelem hasn't been catalogued in an appropriately findable manner, lab A submits this problem to idealab.

Lab B has problem P. Lab B searches for a solution using standard methods. lab B finds lab A's record of problem P on ideaLab. Lab B registers another incidence of problem P.

{\bf Continued from 2015.08.26at15:18}
IdeaLab has a system to rank ideas relative to one another. An idea's rank is a function that increases with the number of users who had this idea. Rank increases with the number of viewers it has.

Think of additional variables that rank varies with. The single most important task in creating ideaLab is to make idea browsing and discovery of ideas work well. IdeaLab is a great way to bring ideas of how to help the human endeavor to the layperson.

Suppose Bob the bricklayer has an idea which helps Portland Cement make a better cement. If only there was a framework for the sharing of ideas to be witnessed and paid for as a percentage of calculated increased profit. Players are motivated to pay handsomely for ideas to encourage new ideas. This an alternative to a conventional research and development department,

IdeaLab's job in this is:  provide the easy access to the hosted ideas, problems, and solutions.[I wanted to add more here about idealab and I wanna work on the idealab site as a web-app. Make this as a ruby, php, or python site.]

People can run independent studies and experiments by throwing food to a group of ducks and recording the responses of the groups. When observing a small group, it seems to observe whether there is altruism displayed. For example, when a large clump of bread is thrown to the group, does the group let all members get some part of the clump or do the dominant ducks hoard the resource?

\subsection*{ \#inDefenseOfPeace }

I have not seen a disagreement that I thought was worth lives. Does fighting make a person tough? Forfeiting thinking for fighting appears to turn righteousness into wrongfulness. Can we think of a better way?

What if we use the money, energy, and passion currently dedicated to an ironically named Department of Defense to find appropriate resolutions to problems? What are you willing to spend to find resolutions which don't cost lives to raise hate?

Peaceful resolutions may be hard to find. People commend soldiers for participating in fights we all fund. What if people spent the same money and lives on clever diplomacy that avoids wars? What if we use love to spread love?

One idea is to reward diplomacy. What if there was a system to which any person can contribute diplomatic ideas and be rewarded for bringing a good idea? What if people could work together to find an elusive peaceful resolution?

Wikipedia's Software Industry article reads "according to industry analyst Gartner, the size of the worldwide software industry in 2013 was US\$407.3 billion." Even in this well funded industry, many of the most effective tools are created and actively maintained by thousands of volunteers. I am talking about open-sourced software.

The term opensource refers to software whose source-code is freely editable. This allows any person to contribute a resolution to any issue. In this way, the opensource community offers competitive solutions which are licensed to remain freely editable by posterity.

Can opensource show us how to collaborate on ideas for peaceful resolutions? Opensource provides solutions which competed with with the leading products of a US\$400 billion industry with notable successes. Opensource software dominates the market for web servers and secure cheap personal computing playgrounds.

Plan to save money at the rate $R$ dollars per time period(e.g. year, month, week, day,..). Put money away in savings in quantity $S$. Purchase in quantity $P$ for repairing the house with top quality fixes that increase equity or other acts which increase assets.

The killer idea here is to count asset-increasing-work as money saved in case saving everything over a reasonable spending limit doesn't work. This is, however, the preferred saving plan: 
\begin{itemize}
\item spend within spending limit $L$;
\item let $E$ be the amount earned during the period;
\item let $J$ be the current project, E.G. 
\item $E = $

\subsection*{ whatDidILearnFromPhysics aLetterToThoseComingAfter }
I learned that approximations which describe a phenomenon to first order are a fine starting place to build an understaning of the phenomenon. I found from this that observations of first oder behavior are a fine place to begin observation. The lesson of the power of the first orders I've learned through many related lessons.

I learned that "limiting cases are a physicist's bread and butter," said some physics professor at OSU. I have found several situations where this statement resounds in my memory. One application I have developed great affection for is in deciding how to make a first guess at a model for observed phenomena.

Using these two teachings together, one can make useful guesses at the behavior of phenomena. From a first order observation, one knows the limiting behavior of $f(x)$ for both decreasing and increasing $x$. This is considered an observation of the behavior of $f(x)$ to first order in $x$.

Notice I said a lot of words to describe what has been observed. All these words have meaning. It is enlightening to know the significance of every single word when a person speaks purposefully.

There are a calculated number of degrees of freedom removed from a general function one may observe to first order in one of its independent variables. Some examples of the behavior of $f(x)$ to first order in $x$ follow.

\begin{itemize}
\item The value of $f$ may increase as the variable $x$ increases:$$f(x_2) > f(x_1) \Leftrightarrow x_2 > x_1.$$ This is said "$f$ varies directly with $x$."
\item The value of $f$ may decrease as the variable $x$ decreases:$$f(x_2) < f(x_1) \Leftrightarrow x_2 < x_1.$$ This is said "f varies inversely with $x$."
\item The value may behave stochastically, chaotically, but always functional. Functional because $f(x)$ always has the same value. Every day of the week.

One way to say this logically and in a way which requires and might teach some, mathematical vocabulary:
"The function $f()$ is a bijective function. $f(x_0)$ is a single value for a single value of $x_0$."(I didn't remember what I started writing...I just came back and it's now time for another quick \\openinglst\$journal\\closedalsting-ing.

Write to Anne Filson to schedule some coffee at lunch-time. I want to write a note asking for a coffee and a conversation. Some things I want to discuss are listed here.

I want to mention gut flora possibly needing the bacterial byproducts of fermentation. I want Anne's input about the data pertaining to the hominin diet. What do we know about homini and human diet throughout the evolution of our species.

This could be a beneficial topic for someone trying to get his message of veganism out to a large audience. This could also be a publishable work: people possibly used to fill their bellies beyond full to both get bacterial growth in the intestines. This thought occurred to me when I noticed after a day of overeating that my belch tasted like alcohol(This was within a month of falling off my bicycle and breaking out my front teeth following a night of drinking and swearing off drinking (except for Rich Tehan's birthday in 2016)).

Collaborate with Google in a way that gives me more power as an "inventor" to get my ideas out so the ideas may better benefit humanity. I have four ideas now that I want to write here before I forget them for Google, including the corporation-and-inventor-collaboration mentioned above.

\subsection*{\#millionDollarIdea}
The items I wanted to address with Ryan Parmeter to present to Google with a witness are those following. I want to have a witnessed meeting with executives from Google to present ideas for Google to use, cutting me some originator's percentage of the profits for the first few years. Ryan could serve as my witness.

Google could make a device and the software to provide functioality like the nest home-control device. This device would serve as an upgrade to older vehicles to provide the features of newer cars as well as any feature that people dream up. Example features are navigation systems, phone interface systems, backup cameras, and antitheft features. This serves as something the EPA might be interested in endorsing because upgrading cars' features would presumably reduce waste by slowing the rate at which cars are disposed of.

Google could offer a feature I call a "sensible text-size" in chrome to detect a main text-display-elements of webpages. Sensible text-size uses the number of characters per line known to be optimal from typesetting. I think this value is 55 to 65 characters per line.

Once this happens, I guess that others would make their implementation of this feature. I imagine that consequent to browsers and power users implementing this feature web design best practices would evolve to evolve to cater to this feature. This feature would allow for command-line-browsing, which propogates the UNIX paradigm of embracing a text-stream as the perfect data-structure.

The efficiency gains in computer-use from implementing the UNIX philosophy segues nicely into the final idea which I am most excited about: Google supplies a chromebook that is made to host crouton. Preferably, Google supplies the drivers for use in a standalone linux installation, so that users don't have to use up resources keeping ChromeOS loaded. Google could mandate that hardware manufacturers supply drivers for their devices to the open-source-community.

I shall start walking every day; getting envigorating exercise multiple times a week. I don't need hobbies to fill up my time because I have the obligation to myself of having thought of living an experiment in health as an example to my fellow people.

People are not humans. I mean this as people are not the blood, flesh, and bone that comprises the physical body of a person. Here I think person as the singular form of people. People are the tiny, apparently singular spark in the brain that is, nevertheless the product of a concerted effort on a statistical number of cells. I make the following broadly generalized statement as a guess at something possibly worth investigating at a later time: the mystery of life can, following from the last sentence be said to be shadowed from our understanding by statistics.

I have stopped into Allen Bros on 26th and Arnold before going to work. I just got done with a partial root canal with the dentist at the Corvalis Gentle Dental. He stopped part of the way through the root canal because he wasn't confident proceeding. His office referred me back to the Gentle Dental in Salem called Gentle Dental at Idlewood.

Idlewood is the office of Wayne Van de Graaf, the oral surgeon who reimplanted my front teeth. This was the morning that I had crashed at around 1am. Dr. Treloar at Corvallis's Good Samaritan ER had originally placed my teeth back in their sockets quickly in hopes of the teeth surviving.

It turned out that Dr. Treloar had replaced the teeth in the incorrect positions and directions. I feel grateful that Treloar had done such a caring and careful job as he did in helping me deal with the consequences of my morning's drunken bike ride from the bar. In order to do my part, I resolved to stop drinking and have been successful other than a shot at Richard Tehan's birthday and a sip of beer at Amanda Tyree's bidding while sitting on Bastendorf Beach watching unrideably small surf with her and Sterling.

I believe I have journaled this before, but I want to say this again: I don't want to drink. Abstinence from alcohol is motivated by a desire to maintain and imrove my health, a desire to be more productive than I am when I drink, and for safety. Falling off my bike and knocking my teeth out was not my first lesson about safety and drinking. I plan to make this incident my last.

Quaternarily, I could speak with one of my cubicle-mates, either Colleen Barr, Patrick Winger, or Vladimir Pedovic.

Really, I should speak to everyone I can. Being strategic about whom I tell my good ideas is more selfish than I like to perceive myself. It is a dance, as, at this moment, it feels like everything is, a dance. This dance is balancing economy of effort and sharing my ideas as much as possible.

I want to propose the idea to make it politically incorrect to feed people animal-products in the same way it is politically incorrect to exclude people with disabilities. This idea comes to me from being outraged that general employee-funds are being spent to provide animal products for food at an EPA function.

It is my opinion that the WED needs to make a bold move to act outside the connotations of its scope. By this I mean that WED needs to concern itself with human endeavor. People are part of the ecology of their region. People are animals. It is pompous, arrogant, conceited, flawed, and dangerous to not model human animals as part of ecosystems.

Sometimes my journal is written in the mode of me telling myself to do things. The following will be a brain dump of thoughts I've recently entertained. Note to self: get your parser ready.
