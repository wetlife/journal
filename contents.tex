\subsection*{\#loveLife}
This is some stuff. The stuff is words, really. The amazing thing is I get to string them together however I please.

I am so in love because of who Amanda Chadderdon is and how lovingly Amanda has behaved toward me. I am scared to tell her this because I think it may scare her off. I don't know what to do.

I say "I'm not sure what to do" as though, and I want to joke that "I \textbf{AM} sure I'll be happy however my life pans out." but I say "I'm not sure" as though...I LOST THE THOUGHT OVER THE COURSE OF HOURS...

\subsection*{\#lifePlan} CONTINUED FROM YESTERDAY'S THOUGHT:
"I have come to the conclusion that..." I should create a vegan cheese while I'm looking for work and working off student loans as a cab-driver. In order to plan and verify feasability, I calculate some basic time requirements imposed by all the things I want to do(after this table, a current plan is to be kept in tabulated form in weeklyTimeTable.tex):

\begin{table}
\caption{\label{tab:originalWeeklyAndDailyTimeTable}Weekly and Daily Time-Table}
\begin{tabular}{|r|r|l|}
\hline
Hours/Week&Hours/Day&Activity\\
\hline
7&1&hygiene\\
7&1&workout\\
49&12$\times$4+1&drive a cab\\
14&2&social and play time\\
42&6&sleep\\
21&3&study graduate physics courses\\
28&4&journal and invent\\
\hline
\end{tabular}\end{table}

This gives $7 \text{days} \times 24 \text{hours} = 168$ hours per week, accounting for the all hours in a week. I intend to investigate using food, sleep, and drugs to augment my productivity in learning and inventing. Here, inventing can be broadly interpretted.

\subsection*{\#invention}
Invention could mean creating a vegan cheese by chemical synthesizing a substrate with the desired percentages and types of fat, protein, and carbohydrate. Invention could mean designing a belt for runners to store an empty or full water bladder in, as well as shopping bags, a phone, pens, keys, clean and dry clothes, and other items. Invention could mean designing a pair of gloves with all the things listed for the belt attached as well as carrying pouches to provide runners with an ergonomic upper-body workout while running.

Make idealab: a database of possibly networked ideas, unsolved problems, and solutions which are easily searched by users. An idea of a use-case: lab A at some institution has a problem which impedes its progress and so it checks with idealab for a solution. Because the solution to this probelem hasn't been catalogued in an appropriately findable manner, lab A submits this problem to idealab.

Lab B has problem P. Lab B searches for a solution using standard methods. lab B finds lab A's record of problem P on ideaLab. Lab B registers another incidence of problem P.

{\bf Continued from 2015.08.26at15:18}
IdeaLab has a system to rank ideas relative to one another. An idea's rank is a function that increases with the number of users who had this idea. Rank increases with the number of viewers it has.

Think of additional variables that rank varies with. The single most important task in creating ideaLab is to make idea browsing and discovery of ideas work well. IdeaLab is a great way to bring ideas of how to help the human endeavor to the layperson.

Suppose Bob the bricklayer has an idea which helps Portland Cement make a better cement. If only there was a framework for the sharing of ideas to be witnessed and paid for as a percentage of calculated increased profit. Players are motivated to pay handsomely for ideas to encourage new ideas. This an alternative to a conventional research and development department,

IdeaLab's job in this is:  provide the easy access to the hosted ideas, problems, and solutions.[I wanted to add more here about idealab and I wanna work on the idealab site as a web-app. Make this as a ruby, php, or python site.]

\subsection*{\#journal, \#DIY-ence, \#ideaLab}
People can run independent studies and experiments by throwing food to a group of ducks and recording the responses of the groups. When observing a small group, it seems to observe whether there is altruism displayed. For example, when a large clump of bread is thrown to the group, does the group let all members get some part of the clump or do the dominant ducks hoard the resource?

I want to read "open access" journals. This will keep me up on subject matters' current evolution.

Language is a beautiful "arbitrary," as in "it was decided," and "mysterious," as in "what things can a study of this thing[, language,] tell us about nature. It beautiful that a finite set of symbols and rules can describe such a seemingly infinite set of things. This is a beauty worth exploring.

\subsection*{ \#inDefenseOfPeace }

I have not seen a disagreement that I thought was worth lives. Does fighting make a person tough? Forfeiting thinking for fighting appears to turn righteousness into wrongfulness. Can we think of a better way?

What if we use the money, energy, and passion currently dedicated to an ironically named Department of Defense to find appropriate resolutions to problems? What are you willing to spend to find resolutions which don't cost lives to raise hate?

Peaceful resolutions may be hard to find. People commend soldiers for participating in fights we all fund. What if people spent the same money and lives on clever diplomacy that avoids wars? What if we use love to spread love?

One idea is to reward diplomacy. What if there was a system to which any person can contribute diplomatic ideas and be rewarded for bringing a good idea? What if people could work together to find an elusive peaceful resolution?

Wikipedia's Software Industry article reads "according to industry analyst Gartner, the size of the worldwide software industry in 2013 was US\$407.3 billion." Even in this well funded industry, many of the most effective tools are created and actively maintained by thousands of volunteers. I am talking about open-sourced software.

The term opensource refers to software whose source-code is freely editable. This allows any person to contribute a resolution to any issue. In this way, the opensource community offers competitive solutions which are licensed to remain freely editable by posterity.

Can opensource show us how to collaborate on ideas for peaceful resolutions? Opensource provides solutions which competed with with the leading products of a US\$400 billion industry with notable successes. Opensource software dominates the market for web servers and secure cheap personal computing playgrounds.

Plan to save money at the rate $R$ dollars per time period(e.g. year, month, week, day,..). Put money away in savings in quantity $S$. Purchase in quantity $P$ for repairing the house with top quality fixes that increase equity or other acts which increase assets.

The killer idea here is to count asset-increasing-work as money saved in case saving everything over a reasonable spending limit doesn't work. This is, however, the preferred saving plan: 
\begin{itemize}
\item spend within spending limit $L$;
\item let $E$ be the amount earned during the period;
\item let $J$ be the current project, E.G. 
\item $E = $
\end{itemize}

With these definitions let $R=S+P$.

\subsection*{ whatDidILearnFromPhysics aLetterToThoseComingAfter }
I learned that approximations which describe a phenomenon to first order are a fine starting place to build an understaning of the phenomenon. I found from this that observations of first oder behavior are a fine place to begin observation. The lesson of the power of the first orders I've learned through many related lessons.

I learned that "limiting cases are a physicist's bread and butter," said some physics professor at OSU. I have found several situations where this statement resounds in my memory. One application I have developed great affection for is in deciding how to make a first guess at a model for observed phenomena.

Using these two teachings together, one can make useful guesses at the behavior of phenomena. From a first order observation, one knows the limiting behavior of $f(x)$ for both decreasing and increasing $x$. This is considered an observation of the behavior of $f(x)$ to first order in $x$.

Notice I said a lot of words to describe what has been observed. All these words have meaning. It is enlightening to know the significance of every single word when a person speaks purposefully.

There are a calculated number of degrees of freedom removed from a general function one may observe to first order in one of its independent variables. Some examples of the behavior of $f(x)$ to first order in $x$ follow.

\begin{itemize}
\item The value of $f$ may increase as the variable $x$ increases:$$f(x_2) > f(x_1) \Leftrightarrow x_2 > x_1.$$ This is said "$f$ varies directly with $x$."
\item The value of $f$ may decrease as the variable $x$ decreases:$$f(x_2) < f(x_1) \Leftrightarrow x_2 < x_1.$$ This is said "f varies inversely with $x$."
\item The value may behave stochastically, chaotically, but always functional. Functional because $f(x)$ always has the same value. Every day of the week.

One way to say this logically and in a way which requires and might teach some, mathematical vocabulary:
"The function $f()$ is a bijective function. $f(x_0)$ is a single value for a single value of $x_0$."(I didn't remember what I started writing...I just came back and it's now time for another quick \\openinglst\$journal\\closedalsting-ing.

Write to Anne Filson to schedule some coffee at lunch-time. I want to write a note asking for a coffee and a conversation. Some things I want to discuss are listed here.

I want to mention gut flora possibly needing the bacterial byproducts of fermentation. I want Anne's input about the data pertaining to the hominin diet. What do we know about homini and human diet throughout the evolution of our species.

This could be a beneficial topic for someone trying to get his message of veganism out to a large audience. This could also be a publishable work: people possibly used to fill their bellies beyond full to both get bacterial growth in the intestines. This thought occurred to me when I noticed after a day of overeating that my belch tasted like alcohol(This was within a month of falling off my bicycle and breaking out my front teeth following a night of drinking and swearing off drinking (except for Rich Tehan's birthday in 2016)).

Discuss the following ideas I've had with Ryan Parmeter, who is a friend from the hesper.net building that Ryan Schrink ran and drained the rainwater out of the ceiling's insulation by pushing a broom up into the plastic layer covering the bottom of the insulation-packs(it was packs similar to, if not exactly, interstud insulation from exterior wall insulation).

Collaborate with Google in a way that gives me more power as an "inventor" to get my ideas out so the ideas may better benefit humanity. I have four ideas now that I want to write here before I forget them for Google, including the corporation-and-inventor-collaboration mentioned above.  

\section*{ 2016.04.02at15:14 }
\subsection*{\#millionDollarIdea}
The items I wanted to address with Ryan Parmeter to present to Google with a witness are those following. I want to have a witnessed meeting with executives from Google to present ideas for Google to use, cutting me some originator's percentage of the profits for the first few years. Ryan could serve as my witness.

Google could make a device and the software to provide functioality like the nest home-control device. This device would serve as an upgrade to older vehicles to provide the features of newer cars as well as any feature that people dream up. Example features are navigation systems, phone interface systems, backup cameras, and antitheft features. This serves as something the EPA might be interested in endorsing because upgrading cars' features would presumably reduce waste by slowing the rate at which cars are disposed of.

Google could offer a feature I call a "sensible text-size" in chrome to detect a main text-display-elements of webpages. Sensible text-size uses the number of characters per line known to be optimal from typesetting. I think this value is 55 to 65 characters per line.

Once this happens, I guess that others would make their implementation of this feature. I imagine that consequent to browsers and power users implementing this feature web design best practices would evolve to evolve to cater to this feature. This feature would allow for command-line-browsing, which propogates the UNIX paradigm of embracing a text-stream as the perfect data-structure.

The efficiency gains in computer-use from implementing the UNIX philosophy segues nicely into the final idea which I am most excited about: Google supplies a chromebook that is made to host crouton. Preferably, Google supplies the drivers for use in a standalone linux installation, so that users don't have to use up resources keeping ChromeOS loaded. Google could mandate that hardware manufacturers supply drivers for their devices to the open-source-community.

Google could lead the way in voice recognition technologies by using veiwers' corrections to Youtube's auto-generated captions.

I propose the following activity to myself. My proposal will will start to sound something like the beginning of a book. That last sentence just seems like a hint and so I wonder if I'll wonder at some point in my life when I first realized writing will be the point of my life's work.

I shall start walking every day; getting envigorating exercise multiple times a week. I don't need hobbies to fill up my time because I have the obligation to myself of having thought of living an experiment in health as an example to my fellow people.

People are not humans. I mean this as people are not the blood, flesh, and bone that comprises the physical body of a person. Here I think person as the singular form of people. People are the tiny, apparently singular spark in the brain that is, nevertheless the product of a concerted effort on a statistical number of cells. I make the following broadly generalized statement as a guess at something possibly worth investigating at a later time: the mystery of life can, following from the last sentence be said to be shadowed from our understanding by statistics.

I have stopped into Allen Bros on 26th and Arnold before going to work. I just got done with a partial root canal with the dentist at the Corvalis Gentle Dental. He stopped part of the way through the root canal because he wasn't confident proceeding. His office referred me back to the Gentle Dental in Salem called Gentle Dental at Idlewood.

Idlewood is the office of Wayne Van de Graaf, the oral surgeon who reimplanted my front teeth. This was the morning that I had crashed at around 1am. Dr. Treloar at Corvallis's Good Samaritan ER had originally placed my teeth back in their sockets quickly in hopes of the teeth surviving.

It turned out that Dr. Treloar had replaced the teeth in the incorrect positions and directions. I feel grateful that Treloar had done such a caring and careful job as he did in helping me deal with the consequences of my morning's drunken bike ride from the bar. In order to do my part, I resolved to stop drinking and have been successful other than a shot at Richard Tehan's birthday and a sip of beer at Amanda Tyree's bidding while sitting on Bastendorf Beach watching unrideably small surf with her and Sterling.

I believe I have journaled this before, but I want to say this again: I don't want to drink. Abstinence from alcohol is motivated by a desire to maintain and imrove my health, a desire to be more productive than I am when I drink, and for safety. Falling off my bike and knocking my teeth out was not my first lesson about safety and drinking. I plan to make this incident my last.

Quaternarily, I could speak with one of my cubicle-mates, either Colleen Barr, Patrick Winger, or Vladimir Pedovic.

Really, I should speak to everyone I can. Being strategic about whom I tell my good ideas is more selfish than I like to perceive myself. It is a dance, as, at this moment, it feels like everything is, a dance. This dance is balancing economy of effort and sharing my ideas as much as possible.

I want to propose the idea to make it politically incorrect to feed people animal-products in the same way it is politically incorrect to exclude people with disabilities. This idea comes to me from being outraged that general employee-funds are being spent to provide animal products for food at an EPA function.

It is my opinion that the WED needs to make a bold move to act outside the connotations of its scope. By this I mean that WED needs to concern itself with human endeavor. People are part of the ecology of their region. People are animals. It is pompous, arrogant, conceited, flawed, and dangerous to not model human animals as part of ecosystems.

We need to address the conflict of interest the USDA has with disseminating health information. 

The study results are in. The evidence is published. Why does public-policy allow people's education in nutrition to be led by agricultural interests.

Sometimes my journal is written in the mode of me telling myself to do things. The following will be a brain dump of thoughts I've recently entertained. Note to self: get your parser ready.

I want to play with evolution by throwing out every kind of flower- and delicious edible fruit seeds at parks. We put money into homeless shelters when we could just grow edible plants in public spaces. Caring for society's people, stated people in general because rich and poor people alike might forage the local spaces, could become an endeavor that private groups and individuals undertake by leaving community-produce-trees by the side of the road.

This is some stuff. The stuff is words, really. The amazing thing is I get to string them together however I please.

I am so in love because of who Amanda Chadderdon is and how lovingly Amanda has behaved toward me. I am scared to tell her this because I think it may scare her off. I don't know what to do.

I say "I'm not sure what to do" as though, and I want to joke that "I \textbf{AM} sure I'll be happy however my life pans out." but I say "I'm not sure" as though...I LOST THE THOUGHT OVER THE COURSE OF HOURS...

\subsection*{\#lifePlan} CONTINUED FROM YESTERDAY'S THOUGHT:
"I have come to the conclusion that..." I should create a vegan cheese while I'm looking for work and working off student loans as a cab-driver. In order to plan and verify feasability, I calculate some basic time requirements imposed by all the things I want to do(after this table, a current plan is to be kept in tabulated form in weeklyTimeTable.tex):

\begin{table}
\caption{\label{tab:originalWeeklyAndDailyTimeTable}Weekly and Daily Time-Table}

\end{tabular}\end{table}

This gives $7 \text{days} \times 24 \text{hours} = 168$ hours per week, accounting for the all hours in a week. I intend to investigate using food, sleep, and drugs to augment my productivity in learning and inventing. Here, inventing can be broadly interpretted.

\subsection*{\#invention}
Invention could mean creating a vegan cheese by chemical synthesizing a substrate with the desired percentages and types of fat, protein, and carbohydrate. Invention could mean designing a belt for runners to store an empty or full water bladder in, as well as shopping bags, a phone, pens, keys, clean and dry clothes, and other items. Invention could mean designing a pair of gloves with all the things listed for the belt attached as well as carrying pouches to provide runners with an ergonomic upper-body workout while running.

IdeaLab has a system to rank ideas relative to one another. An idea's rank is a function that increases with the number of users who had this idea. Rank increases with the number of viewers it has.

Think of additional variables that rank varies with. The single most important task in creating ideaLab is to make idea browsing and discovery of ideas work well. IdeaLab is a great way to bring ideas of how to help the human endeavor to the layperson.

Suppose Bob the bricklayer has an idea which helps Portland Cement make a better cement. If only there was a framework for the sharing of ideas to be witnessed and paid for as a percentage of calculated increased profit. Players are motivated to pay handsomely for ideas to encourage new ideas. This an alternative to a conventional research and development department,

IdeaLab's job in this is:  provide the easy access to the hosted ideas, problems, and solutions.[I wanted to add more here about idealab and I wanna work on the idealab site as a web-app. Make this as a ruby, php, or python site.]

People can run independent studies and experiments by throwing food to a group of ducks and recording the responses of the groups. When observing a small group, it seems to observe whether there is altruism displayed. For example, when a large clump of bread is thrown to the group, does the group let all members get some part of the clump or do the dominant ducks hoard the resource?

\subsection*{ \#inDefenseOfPeace }

I have not seen a disagreement that I thought was worth lives. Does fighting make a person tough? Forfeiting thinking for fighting appears to turn righteousness into wrongfulness. Can we think of a better way?

What if we use the money, energy, and passion currently dedicated to an ironically named Department of Defense to find appropriate resolutions to problems? What are you willing to spend to find resolutions which don't cost lives to raise hate?

Peaceful resolutions may be hard to find. People commend soldiers for participating in fights we all fund. What if people spent the same money and lives on clever diplomacy that avoids wars? What if we use love to spread love?

One idea is to reward diplomacy. What if there was a system to which any person can contribute diplomatic ideas and be rewarded for bringing a good idea? What if people could work together to find an elusive peaceful resolution?

Wikipedia's Software Industry article reads "according to industry analyst Gartner, the size of the worldwide software industry in 2013 was US\$407.3 billion." Even in this well funded industry, many of the most effective tools are created and actively maintained by thousands of volunteers. I am talking about open-sourced software.

The term opensource refers to software whose source-code is freely editable. This allows any person to contribute a resolution to any issue. In this way, the opensource community offers competitive solutions which are licensed to remain freely editable by posterity.

Can opensource show us how to collaborate on ideas for peaceful resolutions? Opensource provides solutions which competed with with the leading products of a US\$400 billion industry with notable successes. Opensource software dominates the market for web servers and secure cheap personal computing playgrounds.

Plan to save money at the rate $R$ dollars per time period(e.g. year, month, week, day,..). Put money away in savings in quantity $S$. Purchase in quantity $P$ for repairing the house with top quality fixes that increase equity or other acts which increase assets.

The killer idea here is to count asset-increasing-work as money saved in case saving everything over a reasonable spending limit doesn't work. This is, however, the preferred saving plan: 
\begin{itemize}
\item spend within spending limit $L$;
\item let $E$ be the amount earned during the period;
\item let $J$ be the current project, E.G. 
\item $E = $

\subsection*{ whatDidILearnFromPhysics aLetterToThoseComingAfter }
I learned that approximations which describe a phenomenon to first order are a fine starting place to build an understaning of the phenomenon. I found from this that observations of first oder behavior are a fine place to begin observation. The lesson of the power of the first orders I've learned through many related lessons.

I learned that "limiting cases are a physicist's bread and butter," said some physics professor at OSU. I have found several situations where this statement resounds in my memory. One application I have developed great affection for is in deciding how to make a first guess at a model for observed phenomena.

Using these two teachings together, one can make useful guesses at the behavior of phenomena. From a first order observation, one knows the limiting behavior of $f(x)$ for both decreasing and increasing $x$. This is considered an observation of the behavior of $f(x)$ to first order in $x$.

Notice I said a lot of words to describe what has been observed. All these words have meaning. It is enlightening to know the significance of every single word when a person speaks purposefully.

There are a calculated number of degrees of freedom removed from a general function one may observe to first order in one of its independent variables. Some examples of the behavior of $f(x)$ to first order in $x$ follow.

\begin{itemize}
  \item The value of $f$ may increase as the variable $x$ increases:$$f(x_2) > f(x_1) \Leftrightarrow x_2 > x_1.$$ This is said "$f$ varies directly with $x$."
   \item The value of $f$ may decrease as the variable $x$ decreases:$$f(x_2) < f(x_1) \Leftrightarrow x_2 < x_1.$$ This is said "f varies inversely with $x$."
   \item The value may behave stochastically, chaotically, but always functional. Functional because $f(x)$ always has the same value. Every day of the week.

One way to say this logically and in a way which requires and might teach some, mathematical vocabulary:
"The function $f()$ is a bijective function. $f(x_0)$ is a single value for a single value of $x_0$."(I didn't remember what I started writing...I just came back and it's now time for another quick \\openinglst\$journal\\closedalsting-ing.

Write to Anne Filson to schedule some coffee at lunch-time. I want to write a note asking for a coffee and a conversation. Some things I want to discuss are listed here.

I want to mention gut flora possibly needing the bacterial byproducts of fermentation. I want Anne's input about the data pertaining to the hominin diet. What do we know about homini and human diet throughout the evolution of our species.

This could be a beneficial topic for someone trying to get his message of veganism out to a large audience. This could also be a publishable work: people possibly used to fill their bellies beyond full to both get bacterial growth in the intestines. This thought occurred to me when I noticed after a day of overeating that my belch tasted like alcohol(This was within a month of falling off my bicycle and breaking out my front teeth following a night of drinking and swearing off drinking (except for Rich Tehan's birthday in 2016)).

Collaborate with Google in a way that gives me more power as an "inventor" to get my ideas out so the ideas may better benefit humanity. I have four ideas now that I want to write here before I forget them for Google, including the corporation-and-inventor-collaboration mentioned above.  

\section*{ 2016.04.02at15:14 }
\subsection*{\#millionDollarIdea}
The items I wanted to address with Ryan Parmeter to present to Google with a witness are those following. I want to have a witnessed meeting with executives from Google to present ideas for Google to use, cutting me some originator's percentage of the profits for the first few years. Ryan could serve as my witness.

Google could make a device and the software to provide functioality like the nest home-control device. This device would serve as an upgrade to older vehicles to provide the features of newer cars as well as any feature that people dream up. Example features are navigation systems, phone interface systems, backup cameras, and antitheft features. This serves as something the EPA might be interested in endorsing because upgrading cars' features would presumably reduce waste by slowing the rate at which cars are disposed of.

Google could offer a feature I call a "sensible text-size" in chrome to detect a main text-display-elements of webpages. Sensible text-size uses the number of characters per line known to be optimal from typesetting. I think this value is 55 to 65 characters per line.

Once this happens, I guess that others would make their implementation of this feature. I imagine that consequent to browsers and power users implementing this feature web design best practices would evolve to evolve to cater to this feature. This feature would allow for command-line-browsing, which propogates the UNIX paradigm of embracing a text-stream as the perfect data-structure.

The efficiency gains in computer-use from implementing the UNIX philosophy segues nicely into the final idea which I am most excited about: Google supplies a chromebook that is made to host crouton. Preferably, Google supplies the drivers for use in a standalone linux installation, so that users don't have to use up resources keeping ChromeOS loaded. Google could mandate that hardware manufacturers supply drivers for their devices to the open-source-community.

I have a related thought. What if I told you that a creature had a magnificent feature, so magnificent because it depends on a huge number of environmental factors beig just the way they are in order for the feature to function as beautifully optimally as it does?

I don't wanna lose that feeling, more like. Man, I do love the computer. I need to write a check if other people like the computer, too, or if they knew enough to know they need to. 

I like to sing out into thee,
Oh, infinite black infinity.

My terminal's characters look so damn pretty! Also, I want to let an open-source project use github as the platform from which to transmit how to sing into infinity by recognizing that your data will be saved at least as long as anything any random person will end up doing. What if thought-energy can be stored up in writing in an analogous manner to how thermal energy from eating hot foods being absorbed by their eater had better have been investigated.

I need to pick a conversation with physics. There is one person I think could help me be much more productive than I would be able to be without her by the sheer excitement I gain by picturing her as perfect. I may just let her live the rest of my life, as is the expectation from each of our respective demographics, without ever knowing how often a beautiful thing that the imaginer imagines must exist has been thought of her. It is seen by observing that last comment that communicating in prose that isn't structured in an enexcusably grammatical-symbol-dense language, prose is a much less exact communication of meaning than a programming language.

I need to create a way to paint sound with a linux machine as follows. The player is dancing with one of the most beautiful phenomena of all time: hysteresis. The performer plays with hysteresis.

How it works is this: the artist gets some input from the sound that has come before. The artist is making sound at the same time. The cool and more easily monetizable thing is this: the hardware people build can be sold conscionably. That is, sold without slowing what could be humans', or really life's, faster advancement by hindering the use of a technology.

One such thing to build is a usb to microphone pocket-sized device. Doesn't this device already sound like a smartphone? This build could be just hardware for sale because I want open-sourced development of the software.

During the time I wrote this, I have cooked an incredible meal. There was no beginning to the preparation of this meal in memory. I used napkins that my mother had for what feels like the duration of forever.

I built the raised-bed in my yard years ago for a blogging project in a sustainability course. I hauled several carloads of fill-dirt and horse manure in surplus household waste-baskets. It was interesting to consider how and why the car handled in the particular peculiar ways it did when it was loaded with fill dirt.

My mom gave me the jars I scooped the beans photographed in my recent post on Facebook.

\subsection*{ iWantto }
I want to grow an herb garden in my room. I also want herb-gardens throughout the house. Let there be a plant in, on, and around every room of the house.

Reflecting solar energy upward, in a way that has a limiting case of a mirror on a roof, seems like a non-negligible transformation of the energy of solar light into heat, presumably. I think the difference lies in water's change in entropy as it changes in phase. This change of phase hides some energy called the latent heat of fission, or, in the case of condensation the analogous hidden energy is called the latent heat of fusion.

Let me explain a foundation topic before proceeding. When heat is added to to an ice-cube, the cube increases in temperature x degrees per hour, where x is how quickly energy is transformed into heat in the cube. A physical scientist who has a temperature unit named after him proved in a seminal experiment that the speed at which mechanical energy is done on something can be measured by its temperature.

Specifically, temperature increases with work done to a system. However, at the temperature of phase-transition, say where one might see ice turn into water, some of this heat seems aborbed because the thermometer shows the same temperature as the ice melts entirely, all the while dumping the same energy into heating the system in a given time. 

So basically I am casting my vote for you and all your friends to foster plants' growth all around you because they are the beatiful organisms that are evolving in a feedback loop with our little astronomical rock. Humans think they are the dominant organism because we do horrendous deeds like chopping and burning down in days what took millenia of a whole ecosystem's effort to produce. Photosynthetic organisms terraformed the earth so that all intelligent life that we know of could exist.

A dirth of plants seems to map so well to the problems of today. We've chopped down forrests for grazing land and seen the land become a desert, just as the state of California is currently being punished for supplying too much agricultural land too densely. There is too much of the carbon-monoxide-like gases in the atmosphere. What do plants breathe?

One clever check of an effect which could reasonably be expected to betray a shortage of plants actively maintaining the terraformed state of our Earth is to check meteorological data to see if there has been a drop in oxygen content while there has been a rise in greenhouse gases(GHGs).

I believe humans would do well to become plant stewards. I want to toil to water the soil so the lands that have my heart don't become one ocean-broken desert.

I really need to start coming back to these journal entries because now I think I found a thought that might benefit humanity.

The idea I recently had for a musical instrument made by listening to and responding to previous journal-entries of any recordable information is my computer-science great idea of all time and likely my first gift to humanity: I will deliver for mankind softwares that I see it can benefit from. Working for the EPA has got to be one of my all-time perfectly ideal jobs: I work to protect American humans from their environment by creating software to fill the needs my clients ask me to at work, but I have asked myself "what if my portfolio was comprised of open-sourced-public-service-projects?"

The great computer science idea is what I call playing hysteresis like and instrument. 

I need to soon find a way to remember things on a regular basis. There are weekly, monthly, annual, and less freequent events I want to remember with greater certainty than I should have had. This is said from one entity waching a sequence of events transpire while communicating artistically with his fellows.

		I want to pursue the idea of inventing journaling in a cross-every-kind-of-computer-use-of-the-word-platform journaling as a way to have a conversation with oneself. It seens like the new users would begin having a conversation with their past selves. Later they might have more conversations with their future-selves.

\subsection*{millionDollarIdea software webApp}
A killer app that I want to author and so get deemed with as much conceptual priority in the sense that priority is given to the person who first conceived a concept is to make a maximally accessible set of shells open to anyone via delivery methods ranging from a javascript and ruby driven internet-facing machine that serves its responses out through http, ssh, or telnet to public terminals that the government has a responsibility to ensure every citizen has access to. This concept that people have a right to access the data of the world is validated by the EN leader who was quoted in a statement that went something like "access to the world's data is a basic human right." The proof that people have the right to the world's data is the indescribable advance it would allow science if everyone had the ability to chase down, take down for later's consideration, or review any poem, pose, idea, music, or other act that could benefit humanity. 

Imagine public terminals at parks and in the streets. Illegal behavior would be on camera. This would prevent many obvious destructive deeds.

Public terminals at parks allow may ease people into recognizing the social benefit of assuming stewardship of their local area by going to the park for whatever needs a presence in their livesw this idea allows connecting with a greater number of people than I suppose people currently interact with. It saddens me how much needless social isolation I can feel in such a large town as the 50,000 inhabitants of Corvallis create.

I see this disgusting practice of proudly proclaiming that interacting with others is loathsome. This saddens me in the same way that cancer saddens me. It seems like this spreading contempt of others is working at what may be a beneficial thing for a true introvert in a way with negative consequences.

This seems like a great place from which to introduce statistics. Use the statistics of pathology to draw a picture of how statistics works for anyone who cares to behold it. Title this thing "One Path to Loving Statistics."

It seems like many lessons begin with a motivation of the subject's matter. What could compel an average person, a person who knows that he or she is the hero of at least one person's story, to understand statistics in a profoundly simple way that allows a transcendental interpretation of the scientific endeavor? What if I assured you that this statistics thing is responsible for the most precise statements we can make about the future? The pose of this last statement needs attentive rephrasing.

Define science as the making and testing of testable predictions. Define philosophy as debating everything else, including meta. I give an example of metascience that is within the realm of philosophy because it neither makes nor tests any testable predictions. That metascientific question asks "what can we really know?"

I keep having the idea of going to parks or some other public-facing space so that others may add seeds of their favorite plants to make a beatiful space that physically nourishes us with foods that grow from plants descended from those planted by us and othersand also physically shades us from solar energy(incidental light from the sun) for the efforts of the global Plant's photosynthetically powered terraforming of the Earth that makes human existance posible.

Dr. Thomas Diettrich,
Will you speak with me about fascinating topics I want to pursue with the aid of computational evaluation of models and other tasks in the field of machine-learning? I have several research tapics in my journal which I can scrape together for our discussion. Among the many topics is an approach to altering climate-change scalably. This topic includes a method for estimating the magnitude of what might turn out to be humanity's greatest pressure on global climate.

I appreciate your paper Machine Learning for Sequential Data: a Review. I hope to collaborate with you on several endeavors. I aspire to help computers, the computational machines we've birthed through the application of sciences, further all manner of science.

Signed,
Kyle Thomas
