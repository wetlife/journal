This is some stuff. The stuff is words, really. The amazing thing is I get to string them together however I please.

I am so in love because of who Amanda Chadderdon is and how lovingly Amanda has behaved toward me. I am scared to tell her this because I think it may scare her off. I don't know what to do.

I say "I'm not sure what to do" as though, and I want to joke that "I \textbf{AM} sure I'll be happy however my life pans out." but I say "I'm not sure" as though...I LOST THE THOUGHT OVER THE COURSE OF HOURS...

\subsection*{#lifePlan}
I wanna journal about what I'll do with my life. I have come to the conclusion that...CONTINUED ON NEXT

\subsection*{#lifePlan} CONTINUED FROM YESTERDAY'S THOUGHT:
"I have come to the conclusion that..." I should create a vegan cheese while I'm looking for work and working off student loans as a cab-driver. In order to plan and verify feasability, I calculate some basic time requirements imposed by all the things I want to do(after this table, a current plan is to be kept in tabulated form in weeklyTimeTable.tex):

\begin{table}
\caption{\label{tab:originalWeeklyAndDailyTimeTable}Weekly and Daily Time-Table}
\begin{tabular}{|r|r|l|}
\hline Hours/Week&Hours/Day&Activity\\\hline
7&1&hygiene\\
7&1&workout\\
49&12$\times$4+1&drive a cab\\
14&2&social and play time\\
42&6&sleep\\
21&3&study graduate physics courses\\
28&4&journal and invent\\\hline
\end{tabular}\end{table}

This gives $7 \text{days} \times 24 \text{hours} = 168$ hours per week, accounting for the all hours in a week. I intend to investigate using food, sleep, and drugs to augment my productivity in learning and inventing. Here, inventing can be broadly interpretted.

\subsection*{#inventionIdeas}
Invention could mean creating a vegan cheese by chemical synthesizing a substrate with the desired percentages and types of fat, protein, and carbohydrate. Invention could mean designing a belt for runners to store an empty or full water bladder in, as well as shopping bags, a phone, pens, keys, clean and dry clothes, and other items. Invention could mean designing a pair of gloves with all the things listed for the belt attached as well as carrying pouches to provide runners with an ergonomic upper-body workout while running.
